## Work History

`Mar 2020 - Now`
__Principal Engineer at Zego__

As Principal Engineer I'm responsible for the B2C area of Zego which includes all consumer interfaces and our new insurance platform. This entails working closely with my 6 staff engineers to make sure work is being coordinated and we're sticking to Zego's platform vision. I also work closely day to day with the Head of Product and the Head of Engineering for the B2C area and reporting to leadership. 

My day to day varies greatly but I'm usually doing 15%-25% coding. This is a mixture of Scala, python and some typescript.

Worked with the other Principal Engineer in designing our new Insurance Platform. This is a architectural vision where we're taking Zego. Utilizing a platform to build our products on based on Scala and Akka. We're currently moving our monolith policies to this new platform.

Other duties include working with teams or individuals where they need help. This can include pairing with developers, helping/peering on RFC's, mentoring, defining archicture or 1:1's with my staff engineers and TL's

__Staff Engineer Deliveroo__

I started at Deliveroo as employee 7 and engineer 2. One of the first thing I worked on was rebuilding the whole front-end and part of the backend for our rebranding. [Original](https://web.archive.org/web/20140630215040/https://deliveroo.co.uk/) and [New](https://web.archive.org/web/20141215033841/https://deliveroo.co.uk/)

After that initial rebranding I worked in many area's of Deliveroo. Mainly around the checkout and payments areas and then finally in the realtime fraud detection.

When I started at Deliveroo we did about 300 orders on a good night. When I left we were over 600k orders a day.

Some notiable achivements


  - Worked with many teams to help them scale and architect their solutions
  - Move or world wide payments of our riders (60-70k at the time) over to Citibank payments
  - Launching 6 new countries in the space of a few months. This include brand new payment providers and payment methods like iDeal payments and Sofort 
  - Geosharding Deliveroo into country specific regions so one regional failure didn't bring down everything
  - Keeping the monolith running include major Ruby upgrades
  - Helped keeping Deliveroo PSD2 compliant in all of our EU regions
