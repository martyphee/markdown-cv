## Work History

`Mar 2020 - Now`
__Principal Engineer at Zego__

As Principal Engineer I'm responsible for the B2C area which includes all consumer interfaces and our new insurance platform. I do work closely day to day with the Head of Product and the Head of Engineering for the B2C area and reporting to leadership.

My day to day varies greatly but I'm usually doing 15%-25% coding. This is a mixture of Scala, python and some typescript.

Other duties include working with teams or individuals where they need help. This can include pairing with developers, helping/peering on RFC's, mentoring, defining archicture or 1:1's with my staff engineers and TL's 



`Aug 2014 - Mar 2020`
__Staff Engineer Deliveroo__

I started at Deliveroo as employee 7 and engineer 2. One of the first thing I worked on was rebuilding the whole front-end and part of the backend for our rebranding. [Original](https://web.archive.org/web/20140630215040/https://deliveroo.co.uk/) and [New](https://web.archive.org/web/20141215033841/https://deliveroo.co.uk/)

After that initial rebranding I worked in many area's of Deliveroo. Mainly around the checkout and payments areas and then finally in the realtime fraud detection.

Some notiable achivements

  - Move all of our rider payments (35-40k at the time) over to Citibank payments
  - Launching 6 new countries in the space of a few months. This include brand new payment providers and methods like iDeal payments
  - Geosharding Deliveroo so one regional failure didn't bring down everything
  - Keeping the monolith running include major Ruby upgrades
