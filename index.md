## Work History

`Mar 2020 - Now`
__Principal Engineer at Zego__

As Principal Engineer I'm responsible for Zego UK which includes all consumer interfaces and our new insurance platform. This entails working closely with my 6 staff engineers to make sure work is being coordinated and we're sticking to Zego's platform vision. I also work closely day to day with the Head of Product and the Head of Engineering and reporting to leadership. 

My day to day varies greatly, but I'm usually doing about 75% coding where help is needed. This includes occasionally working on platform Scala/Akka applications, Django monolith (Python), various other Python services and our React Native Delivery Application. Along with the coding I also line manage 4 Staff Engineers and help mentor our more junior engineers.

In 2022 after coming to the conclusion our monolith wasn't going to scale and the amount of work required to fix issues was too great we decided to build a new Insurance Platform using Scala and Akka. I worked alongside the other Principal Engineer and Staff Engineers to architect and design a new platform which would allow Zego to scale and innovate more rapidly.

__Staff Engineer Deliveroo__

I started at Deliveroo as employee 7 and engineer 2. One of the first thing I worked on was rebuilding the front-end and part of the backend for our rebranding. [Original](https://web.archive.org/web/20140630215040/https://deliveroo.co.uk/) and [New](https://web.archive.org/web/20141215033841/https://deliveroo.co.uk/)

After that initial rebranding I worked in many area's of Deliveroo. Mainly around the checkout and payments areas and then finally in the realtime fraud detection.

When I started at Deliveroo we did about 300 orders on a good night. When I left we were over 600k orders a day.

Some notiable achivements
  - Built out payments system (frontend and backend) to work with Stripe, Braintree/PayPal and Checkout.com depending on which country you were in.
  - Worked with many teams to help them scale and architect their solutions
  - Moved our worldwide payments of our riders from a manual BACS process (60-70k at the time) over to Citibank payments
  - Launching 6 new countries in the space of a few months. This include brand new payment providers and payment methods like iDeal payments and Sofort 
  - Geosharding Deliveroo into country specific regions so one regional failure didn't bring down everything
  - Keeping the monolith running including major Ruby upgrades
  - Helped keeping Deliveroo PSD2 compliant in all of our EU regions
  - Worked our Postgres instances to make sure they'd scale and handle our increasing load


`Apr 2011 - Aug 2014`

Our current development stack is a modified version of the JHipster stack utilizing AngularJS, Spring 4 and Hibernate 4. Current clients stacks utilize Postgres and MongoDB for the backends or their preference.
